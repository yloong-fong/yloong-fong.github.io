The invasion rallied young fighters from around the world, including future founder Osama bin Laden (also, Usama bin Laden).  In 1984, bin Laden used his considerable personal wealth to assist former professor, Palestinian religious scholar, and mentor Abdullah al-Azzam in establishing a network of offices in Europe, the United States, and the Arab world known as maktab al-khadimat.  These offices, intended to recruit, train, and equip foreign fighters to participate in the conflict, served as the organizational foundation for what would become al-Qaida proper.  After the eventual withdrawal of Soviet forces from Afghanistan in 1989, bin Laden and Azzam maintained their network of an estimated 10,000-20,000 fighters under the name al-Qaida (Arabic for “the base”) for future jihad.  Al-Qaida's message to the Muslim world is generally framed in terms of a ""defensive jihad,"" in which attacks are used as a defensive measure against enemies of Islam. After the death of Azzam in 1989, bin Laden moved the base of operations from Afghanistan to Sudan to facilitate jihad against secular, pro-Western governments in the Middle East and to aid the Islamist movement in Sudan.  Though the organization's criticism of the United States strengthened after U.S. troops intervened in the Persian Gulf following the 1991 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, al-Qaida efforts during the early 1990s remained focused on regional issues and resulted in sporadic attacks on U.S. forces in various locations including Saudi Arabia, Somalia, and Yemen.  In 1996, al-Qaida formally declared war on the United States and signaled an official shift from targeting local secular regimes and Western powers in the region (the “near enemy”) to attacking the U.S. homeland (the “far enemy”).  No longer welcome in Sudan, bin Laden shifted al-Qaida's base of operations back to Afghanistan, where he cultivated a relationship with increasingly powerful Taliban leaders.  During the late 1990s, al-Qaida strengthened its ties to other terrorist groups, built an extensive fundraising network, and successfully incorporated Ayman al-Zawahiri as its second in command.  The 1998 attacks against the U.S. embassies in Tanzania and Kenya signaled al-Qaida's first successes in attacking enemy targets in non-Muslim countries. Sources indicate that bin Laden seriously miscalculated the force with which the United States government would respond to the 9/11 terrorist attacks.  After American forces devastated the ruling Taliban in November, 2001, bin Laden and the core al-Qaida leadership were again denied safe refuge and fled to the Pakistani tribal regions.  Their influence, however, remained potent as the al Qaida core leadership endorsed and lent political, military, and financial strength to the insurgency in Iraq under Abu Musab al Zarqawi, which became known as al-Qaida in Iraq.  In May 2011, U.S. Special Forces killed Osama bin Laden in Abbottabad, Pakistan. In the weeks following bin Laden's death, al-Qaida announced Ayman al-Zawahiri as the organization's new leader, elevating him from his role as operational commander of the organization's terrorist efforts.

At these compounds, members were educated at JAF's Open Quranic Universities, took part in paramilitary training exercises, and were required to donate a large portion of their income to help finance the group. To disguise the true intentions of these compounds, Gilani framed them as non-profit organizations (e.g., Muslims in the Americas) devoted to helping Muslims find peace in a corrupt Western society. Through these front organizations, JAF engaged in fraudulent financial operations, smuggled weapons to and from the US, and obtained donations from donors who perceived these non-profits as having legitimate goals. Beyond its illegal non-violent activities, JAF members were involved in several violent activities (e.g. bombings and assassinations) that earned them recognition on the State Department's list of 'other terrorist organizations' in 1995.

To house its members and train them to “purify Islam through violence,” JAF established “covert training compounds” in nearly 35 states. At these compounds, members were educated at JAF's Open Quranic Universities, took part in paramilitary training exercises, and were required to donate a large portion of their income to help finance the group. To disguise the true intentions of these compounds, JAF framed them as non-profit organizations (e.g., Muslims in the Americas) devoted to helping Muslims find peace in a corrupt Western society. Through these front organizations, JAF engaged in fraudulent financial operations, smuggled weapons to and from the US, and obtained donations from donors who perceived these non-profits as having legitimate goals. Beyond its illegal non-violent activities, JAF members were involved in several violent activities (e.g. bombings and assassinations) that earned them recognition on the State Department's list of 'other terrorist organizations' in 1995. With several members incarcerated and their financing and weapons trafficking operations exposed, JAF ceased most of its criminal activities, which subsequently led the State Department to drop them from its list in 2000. Since then JAF has reentered the limelight on few occasions, most notably in 2002 when Daniel Pearl was abducted on his way to interview a JAF leader about the alleged connection between JAF and an individual who attempted to bomb American Airlines flight 63 in 2001.

Towards these goals, and with financial and material support from Saddam Hussein, the MKO targeted Iran's domestic and overseas interests in general and Iranian embassies around the world in particular. The MKO also targeted the interests of other countries – most notably, US businesses and citizens throughout Iran – that abetted the regime. With a headquarters in Iraq, the leaders within the MKO took several measures to cooperate with the United States during Operation Iraqi Freedom: for instance, the MKO signed a cease-fire agreement with the US Army; relinquished more than 2,000 tanks, armored personnel carriers and heavy artillery; and several members renounced the MKO and repatriated back to Iran [Source 3].

While Wickstrom's sentence was commuted on the basis that he would renounce the SPC, he found himself back behind bars after moving to Pennsylvania and being arrested for attempting to distribute a large quantity of counterfeit money.

In this “constitutional township,” there was no legal authority higher than the county-level judge,  a job the founder of SPC appointed himself to. Beyond being established to fall outside of federal and state authority, Tigerton Dells was used as a base for SPC counterinsurgency seminars, informational sessions (on the procedures and methods of evading state and federal taxes), and tactical training operations – all of which attracted thousands of activists from, for instance, the Ku Klux Klan and the Minutemen. In addition to their anti-tax activities, members of the SPC stockpiled weapons, stole property, counterfeited money and violated local zoning laws. SPC members also engaged in violent activities: for instance, on February 13, 1983 two US Marshalls were killed and two others wounded during a shoot out with Gordon Kahl, the late leader of the SPC who evaded capture for four months before being killed in a gun battle with the police on June 3, 1983. Kahl's death signaled the beginning of the law enforcement's crackdown on the SPC. From 1983 to 1985, state and federal law enforcement efforts led to the arrests of several members (including Wickstrom), the uncovering of illegal weapon and ammunition caches and the seizure of property/trailers from Tigerton Dells. While Wickstrom's sentence was commuted on the basis that he would renounce the SPC, he found himself back behind bars after moving to Pennsylvania and being arrested for attempting to distribute a large quantity of counterfeit money. While the SPC is defunct, its ideology continues to exist and is spread through several mediums, most notably Wickstrom's online blog.",-99,-99,1969,"The Sheriff's Posse Comitatus (SPC) was a right-wing extremist organization that adhered to Common Law theory and espoused the Christian Identity religious doctrine along with a fiercely anti-government political philosophy.  As CI followers, SPC members believed that the white race was superior to all other races, particularly Jews and Blacks, and that the United States government was corrupt and influenced by Jews and communists. Politically, the SPC despised federal authority and thus took up its name (Latin for ""power of the county"") to reflect this – that is, the name was drawn from the 1878 Posse Comitatus Act, which limited the ability of the federal government to use the military for law enforcement purposes while expanding the legal powers of the county sheriff.
