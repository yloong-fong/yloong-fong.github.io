Cikoja was on his way to his own car, when he collapsed on the front stoop.  Croatian nationalists are suspected to be responsible for the incident because Cikoja had received a threat letter , three months prior to his murder, from a group calling itself the ""Croatian Nationalist Army"", demanding that he pay $5,000 by August towards the group's cause for independence, or otherwise he would be killed.

Additionally, it is unclear whether the letters may have been sent by the Yugoslav secret police in efforts to discredit the Croatian separatist movement, as some American-Croatian community leaders believe to be the case. This incident is linked to the firebombing, about a week later,  of a shop in Chicago, owned by an American of Croatian descent (197810040004) as well as the murder of another American of Croatian descent, Krizan Brkic, in California, who has also received a similar threatening letter (197811220002). In June of 1981, eight men were arrested and indicted on charges of racketeering and extortion, including the murders of Cikoja and Brkic, and several arsons.  According to the indictments, the men were members of a Croatian organization called ""Otpor,"" or Croatian National Resistance group that used terror and violence to extort money from individuals of Croatian origin living in the United States. A ninth man was later arrested and indicted as an associate of the other eight responsible for the abovementioned incidents.
