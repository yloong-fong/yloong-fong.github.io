## What is this page about?

Hi there! I'm a Master's student in Columbia's Quantitative Methods in Social Sciences programme. As part of the course, we were asked to complete a few data visualisation assignments on different topics of interest. I have decided to compile the different visualisations on this site because I think they are rather interesting and insightful.
